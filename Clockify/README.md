## Clockify Reports template.xlsm
This macro-enabled workbook was a template created to help facilitate reporting for accounts receivable. The bookkeeper would pull a single, master report and paste it into the workbook. They would then run a macro that did minor manipulations on the data before creating individual reports named after the client. The workbook may include some anonymized test data.
