# Box Tracking
Custom workbook to facilitate the tracking of boxes through a production process. This repository only includes the VBA and obfuscates identifying information. The workbook itself is branded with company logos in various spots and thus not publicly available.

## Description
Users create individual project tabs via a form and update box statuses there. Summary data is pulled into a Master Tracking sheet via cell formulas.
